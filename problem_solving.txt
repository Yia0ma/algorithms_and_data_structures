# Big O Notation

    Big O notation is a mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.

    O(1) - constant
    O(log(n)) - logarithmic
    O(n) - linear
    O(n log(n))
    O(n^2) - quadratic

# Problem Solving

    1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
    2. What are the inputs that go into the problem?
    3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
    4. Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? (Do I have enought information to solve the problem).
    5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

# Break It Down

    Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.

# Solve The Problem or Solve A Simpler Problem

# Simplify

    1. Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do.
    2. Temporarily ignore that difficulty.
    3. Write a simplified solution.
    4 Then incorporate that difficulty back in.

# Look Back and Refactor

    1. Can you check the result?
    2. Can you derive the result differently?
    3. Can you understand it at a glance?
    4. Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
    5. Can you improve the performance of your solution?
    6. Can you think of other ways to refactor?
    7. How have other people solved this problem?
